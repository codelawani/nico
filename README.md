DutyCircle - Social Todo list App

DutyCircle is a unique application designed to merge task management with public accountability. Users can create and manage personal tasks while also choosing to share them publicly. The public sharing feature transforms a simple task into a commitment, offering users an external motivation to accomplish their goals. The public feed showcases tasks from various users, giving an opportunity for users to connect over shared objectives or interests.

Technologies: NextJs, Postgresql, Tailwind Css
Live: here | GitHub: here
Future plans: I plan to add more features to DutyCircle, such as the ability to create circles(groups) and collaborate on tasks.
